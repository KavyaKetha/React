// React.lazy currently only supports default exports. If the module you want to import uses named exports,
//  you can create an intermediate module that reexports it as the default. This ensures that tree shaking 
//  keeps  working and that you donâ€™t pull in unused components.
// export { MyComponent as default } from "./ManyComponents.js"; ==>should be exported in the respective component in this way
